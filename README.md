# BAR2-D2

This repo is for a robotic bartender I'm creating known as BAR2-D2. Its main components are a raspberry pi, arduino, and peristaltic pumps. The raspberry pi hosts a Django webapp that controls the user interface. It's gimmicky, but I wanted to full stack learn web development. The entire system will be built into a custom bar cart for portability and aesthetics. 

I will finish this readme once the bot is done. I've mostly finished the web app code (for the UI) and the microporessor code (for the pumps). I really just need to construct the cart itself and inevitably tweak the code.
